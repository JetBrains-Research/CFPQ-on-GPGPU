# fast boolean semiring matrix multiplication for CFPQ

## Implementations

* CPU:
  * matrix multiplication using m4ri lib
  * sparse boolean matrix multiplication using libs on Python
* GPU:
  * naive matrix multiplication with packed into uint32 boolean values
  * Four Russians method for matrix multiplication with packed into uint32 boolean values

## Documentation

### Prerequirements.
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is installed and started.
2. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is installed.
3. Some of the tests require `Cuda`, you cannot run these tests without a `Nvidia` video card. CPU-based implementations can be run anyway.

### Quick start

1. Clone this repo

2. Build docker image
All tests should run inside docker, so first of all you should build image via `Dockerfile` in root folder.  
We use `ubuntu 18.04` with `CUDA` compability as main image and install `anaconda`, `mono`, `m4ri library`, and some usefull utilites. Builded image has entrypoint for run testing, so generate tests description file and run docker with mounting project root folder.  

3. Initialize dataset
Run `init.py` inside Docker:
```(bash)
docker run -v /<path to project>:/work/ <image name> init.py
```

This way you install [`GTgraph`](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/), generate graphs, unpack big real-world graphs.
If you want to customize dataset, you can modify and run appropriate functions from this script.

4. Generate tests description
For testing system we use `tests.csv` file which describes all tests, we need it because differents tests may use same files, you can't run testing **without** this file. For creating this file you can use `test_utils/build_testset.py` script, it has only parameter â€’ path to folder with data.  
For example, if your data stores in `data` folder, run this command for generate tests description:

```(bash)
python test_utils/build_testset.py data
```

5. Run tests  

Use the following command to run tests.
```(bash)
docker run -v /<path to project>:/work/ <image name> testing_system.py tests.csv
```

After running tests, you can find `result.csv` file in root folder with time measure for each test and each solution in table format.  

### Data representation  
All tests are divided to groups and placed in different folders. Each folder must contain `Grammars` folder with describing all grammars and `Matrices` for describing all graphs of this group. Tests for each group is cross product of all grammars and graphs in it.  
**grammar** file is a file with rules definition in format: `nt nt1 nt2`, which means `nt1 -> nt1 nt2`, or `a T`, which means `a -> T`. We use capital letters for terminal symbols and other letters/words for non-terminal.  
**graph** file contain description of graph with lines likes `0 T 1`, where `0` and `1` is vertices numbers and `T` is a terminal symbol for this edge.  
So, if you want to add your data, just put it in data folder in described format and rebuild `tests.csv`.
